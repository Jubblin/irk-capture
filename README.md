# IRK Capture for ESPHome

![Linting Status](https://github.com/DerekSeaman/irk-capture/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg) [![Buy Me a Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20a%20Coffee-donate-yellow?logo=buy-me-a-coffee&logoColor=white)](https://buymeacoffee.com/vdereks)

This ESPHome package will capture Apple and Android Bluetooth Identity Resolving Keys (IRK) using an ESP32 running ESPHome. Use the captured IRKs with the [Private BLE Device](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/private_ble_device/) integration in Home Assistant for reliable room-level presence detection. I use the [Bermuda BLE Trilateration](https://github.com/agittins/bermuda?tab=readme-ov-file) integration with IRKs for room-level presence detection.

This ESPHome IRK capture package is only designed to capture IRKs and can NOT pull double duty as a Bluetooth proxy. You can either flash this to a spare ESP32 device and keep it in a sock drawer when not being used, or temporarily flash this package to an ESP32 then flash back to your generic Bluetooth proxy ESPHome configuration. IRKs are generally permanent and do not change over time.

## What is a BLE IRK and Why Is It Needed?

Modern Apple and Android devices use **BLE privacy features** that randomize their MAC addresses periodically to prevent tracking. This creates a problem for ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy tracking in Home Assistant - your device appears as a different device every time its MAC address changes. This can happen as often as every 15 minutes.

The **Identity Resolving Key (IRK)** is a cryptographic key exchanged during BLE pairing that allows authorized devices to resolve these random MAC addresses back to the original device. By capturing a device's IRK, you can reliably track it for presence detection even as it randomizes its MAC address.

Capturing IRKs from devices can be very tricky, as the Bluetooth stack can very widely among OS versions and device vendors. Some devices may not play well with this package, or need pairing code tweaks to successfully capture the IRK. I have added a lot of debugging code which could help your favorite vibe coding LLM read the debug logs and provide suggested code changes.

The ESP32 uses a **random static address** for BLE advertising, which is regenerated each time the device boots. This address serves as both the advertised MAC address and the identity address for pairing. The "Generate New MAC" button also changes this address. However, if your phone or watch has previously paired with the ESP32, it may still have cached bond information. To ensure your device sees the ESP32 as completely new, either restart the ESP32 or use "Generate New MAC", and then **forget the pairing** on your phone/watch before attempting to pair again.

## Track Who's in Each Room with ESPHome + Bermuda BLE

## What This Package Does

This IRK capture component turns your ESP32 into a BLE peripheral that can emulate different device types to capture IRKs from various platforms. It supports two BLE profiles:

- **Heart Sensor Profile** (for Apple devices, Android watches): Advertises as a heart rate monitor, which Apple devices and many Android watches can discover (with third party app)
- **Keyboard Profile** (for Android phones): Advertises as a "Logitech K380" keyboard, which bypasses Samsung's aggressive BLE filtering on Galaxy phones

When your Apple or Android device pairs with the ESP32:

1. The ESP32 presents itself as the selected BLE device type (heart rate sensor or keyboard)
2. Your device initiates a secure pairing process
3. During pairing, the device shares its IRK with the ESP32
4. The IRK is captured and exposed as a Home Assistant text sensor
5. You can then use this IRK with the Private BLE Device integration for presence tracking

## Requirements

- **ESP32 board** with Bluetooth support (any variant: ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, ESP32-S3, etc.)
- **ESP-IDF framework** (required - this component does NOT support Arduino framework)
- **ESPHome** 2026.7 or newer - Tested with 2026.7.4
- **Home Assistant** (optional, but recommended for using the captured IRK with Private BLE Device integration)
- **ESPHome Device Builder** (optional, but makes managing ESPHome devices in Home Assistant easier)

## Installation Instructions

I’ve written a detailed blog post that covers the installation and usage of ESPHome Device Builder. It shows you how to build a device profile for your ESP32 and capture your device IRKs. You can find it here:
[How-To: Using my ESPHome Bluetooth IRK Capture Package](https://www.derekseaman.com/2026/01/how-to-using-my-bluetooth-irk-capture-package.html)

The super abbreviated installation instructions are as follows:

- Build a new ESPHome device specific to your ESP32 board
- Add the shown **packages:** section at the bottom
- Connect your ESP32 device and flash it

ESPHome Device Builder pulls the package and component from the `main` branch, so clean builds always get the latest version. My blog post includes optional Seeed Studio XIAO S3, C3, C5 and C6 device profile enhancements.

You can find the **packages:** content here: [irk-capture-device-remote.yaml](https://github.com/DerekSeaman/irk-capture/blob/main/ESPHome%20Devices/irk-capture-device-remote.yaml)

## Usage Instructions

Again, my blog post covers usage in detail. However, the super short version is as follows:

- In Home Assistant go to Settings > ESPHome -> Your ESP32 IRK Capture Device
- Select the appropriate BLE profile (Heart Sensor for Apple devices and Android watches, Keyboard for Android phones)
- Pair your phone or watch with the advertising ESP32 device name
- Watch the Sensors IRK value and it should display the captured IRK
- Paste the captured IRK into the Private BLE Device integration in Home Assistant

## Optional: Auto-Add Captured IRKs to Private BLE Device

By default you copy the captured IRK into the Private BLE Device integration
by hand. If you'd rather have it added automatically as soon as it's
captured, there's an optional Home Assistant blueprint + `rest_command`
setup for that — see
[docs/private-ble-auto-add.md](docs/private-ble-auto-add.md).

## Home Assistant Entities

## Troubleshooting Tips

### The Provided IRK does not match any BLE devices that Home Assistant can see

This is most common on some Android devices and happens when you input the captured IRK into the Private BLE Device field. This happens because Home Assistant can’t see the corresponding BLE device that matches the IRK. Some Android devices only broadcast BLE beacons very infrequently. This means Home Assistant may not have recently seen the BLE device, thus it can’t match the IRK. Unfortunately the solution to this is very device and OS specific, and may not be solvable. I suggest Googling your device and see if any settings can be changed to increase the frequency of the BLE advertising.

### ESP32 Device Name Not Appearing in Bluetooth Settings

- **Turn off Bluetooth** on your device
- Press the **"Restart Device"** button to reset the ESP32's BLE stack
- Ensure the **"BLE Advertising"** switch is ON
- Turn your device's Bluetooth back on and connect to the ESP32
- If ESP32 device does not appear on Android, see the section below

### Android Phone can't see ESP32 Device Name

Samsung One UI 7 (Galaxy S25, S24, etc.) aggressively filters BLE devices in Bluetooth settings. To restore visibility:

1. **Enable Developer Options**: Settings → About Phone → Software Information → Tap "Build Number" 7 times
2. **Enable BLE visibility**: Settings → Developer Options → Scroll down and enable **"Show unsupported Bluetooth LE devices in Bluetooth settings"**
3. Return to Bluetooth settings and scan again — the ESP32 device should now appear
4. Tap on the device (e.g., "Logitech K380" when using Keyboard profile) and tap pair. The IRK should appear in the ESP32 logs and ESPHome device page in Home Assistant

### Android Phone still not visible after Developer Options fix

If the Developer Options fix doesn't work, or you're on a non-Samsung Android device with similar filtering, try using the nRF Connect app:

1. Install **nRF Connect** from the Play Store (by Nordic Semiconductor)
2. Open the app and tap "Scan"
3. Look for "Logitech K380" in the device list (when using Keyboard profile)
4. Tap on it to connect
5. The pairing dialog should appear, allowing the bonding process to complete
6. Look for the captured IRK in the ESP32 logs or the ESPHome device page

### GrapheneOS / Hardened Android — "Incorrect PIN or passkey" Error

GrapheneOS (and some other hardened Android builds) enforces **mandatory authenticated pairing** for HID Keyboard devices. Because a Bluetooth keyboard could theoretically inject keystrokes, GrapheneOS requires a PIN or passkey confirmation before completing the bond. IRK Capture uses "Just Works" pairing (no PIN), so GrapheneOS rejects the Keyboard profile pairing and shows "Incorrect PIN or passkey" on the phone.

**Symptoms:**

- Phone shows "Incorrect PIN or passkey" during pairing
- An IRK may appear in the logs and ESPHome device page, but pasting it into the Private BLE Device integration reports "The provided IRK does not match any BLE devices that Home Assistant can see"
- After rotating the ESP32 MAC address and retrying, the connection fails with `ENC_CHANGE status=1035`

The captured IRK is invalid for use in Home Assistant because GrapheneOS considers the bond incomplete and may immediately rotate to a new RPA key state, or the IRK is from a pairing that was aborted before HA's passive scanner could see the device advertising with it.

**Solution: Switch to the Heart Sensor profile.**

GrapheneOS does not enforce MITM-authenticated pairing for heart rate sensors, so Just Works pairing succeeds cleanly and the captured IRK will work correctly.

1. On the ESPHome device page in Home Assistant, change **BLE Profile** to **"Heart Sensor"**
2. Wait ~30 seconds for the ESP32 to reboot and begin advertising
3. On your GrapheneOS phone, open Bluetooth settings and pair to the heart rate sensor device
4. The IRK will be captured and published — use it in the Private BLE Device integration as normal

### Android Watches

Many Android watches aggressively filter BLE devices, and by default neither the keyboard or heart sensor will be shown as a pairable device. However, the app "Gear Tracker II" (no affiliation) overcomes this aggressive BLE filtering and should allow you pair your watch to the ESP32 and extract the IRK.

Watches that require "reverse" pairing (i.e. the watch advertises as a device that needs to be paired with) will NOT work with this package. This package requires your watch pair TO the ESP32, not the other way around.

### IRK Not Captured After Pairing

Not all devices use Bluetooth security when pairing to some accessories. For example, some Garmin watches are known to use a fixed BLE address, and thus do not have an IRK value. The ESP32 logs and the Home Assistant IRK sensor will indicate that no IRK was used.

- After pairing, **forget/unpair the BLE device** from your device's Bluetooth settings
- Turn Bluetooth OFF on your device
- Modify the BLE Device Name on the ESPHome device page
- Turn Bluetooth ON on your device
- Try pairing to the ESP32 again
- If that still fails, power cycle your phone/watch/tablet, power cycle your ESP32, change the BLE Device Name, and try pairing again

### Upgrading to a New Version

When upgrading IRK Capture to a new version, always perform a clean build to ensure all component changes are fully compiled:

1. In ESPHome Device Builder, open your IRK Capture device
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the lower right and select **"Clean Build Files"**
3. After the clean completes, click **"Install"** to rebuild and flash

Skipping the clean step can result in stale cached object files being linked against the new component source, which may cause unexpected behavior even if the flash appears to succeed.
